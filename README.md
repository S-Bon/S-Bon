- 👋 Hi, I’m @S-Bon
- 👀 I’m interested in data science. In 2020 I became Alteryx Core Certified. After that I completed the Predictive Analytics for Business Nanodegree from Udacity in December 2020, and finished my Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate September 2021. Alteryx Advanced Certified in October 2023. 
- 🌱 I’m currently doing intermediate SQL challenges while I job search. 
- 💞️ Recently I worked a 1-year contract at Lockheed Martin Aeronautics. Learned a lot!
- Top 3: Alteryx, Tableau, SQL
- Next 3: Python, Power BI, and the rest depends where my next job takes me.
